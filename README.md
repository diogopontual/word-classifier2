My second attempt to solve this challenge: https://github.com/hola/challenge_word_classifier. The first is here: https://github.com/diogopontual/word-classifier.

Now, the recipe is:

1. Identify ~300 binary characteristics of a word;
2. Generate 1,000,000 random individuals. Each individual has a value from -5 to 5 for each characteristic;
3. Test each individual over 100,000 words;
4. Kill the worst 20%;
5. Marry the survivors;
6. Each couple must have 4 children;
7. Generate 10.000 random individuals;
8. Test each individual over 100,000 words;
9. Kill the 2 worst children of each family;
10. goto step 4;
11. Whenever the population reaches 3,000,000 of individuals, there will be health problems. A plague will kill half of the population. The weaker half.
